# Tiny Link
This is an example of a simple retro Platformer with a small tile-based Level Editor. For the sake of simplicity, this does not use a true ECS but rather a simple Actor inheritance system. For larger projects a proper ECS-like system is probably a good idea.

Sprite Resources are created in [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), so you will need that if you wish to modify the graphics. The Aseprite Tag feature was used to dictate Animations within a single Sprite.

This was originally a project created in 15 hours for a live stream. The original [can be found here](https://github.com/NoelFB/tiny_link).
