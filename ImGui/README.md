# Foster.ImGui
This is a sample implementation of ImGui.NET in Foster.

This sample requires the [ImGui.NET Repository](https://github.com/ImGuiNET/ImGui.NET) to be cloned in an adjacent folder to Foster.

For example:
```
C:/Projects/Foster/
C:/Projects/ImGui.NET/
```

This Sample is intentionally not in the `Foster.sln` as it will fail to build if ImGui.NET is not cloned.
